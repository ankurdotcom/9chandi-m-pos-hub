```
Plan
Technology Stack:

Frontend: Flutter (for cross-platform support for mobile, tablet, kiosk)
Backend: Node.js or Django (for managing server-side operations and database)
Database: PostgreSQL or Firebase (for real-time updates)
Thermal Printing: Utilize printer libraries like esc_pos_printer for Flutter or qz.io for Node.js to print receipts.
QR Code: Generate QR code using qr_flutter for Flutter or qrcode for Node.js.
Authentication: Use short-lived OTP tokens, possibly using JWT.
Dual Screen Support: Use Flutter for a custom view for both customer and salesperson interfaces on the tablet.
High-Level Workflow:

Step 1: Order Placement (Token Counter):

Customer places an order at the token counter.
Payment is made (support for multiple payment methods).
A token is generated in the form of an OTP or QR code, based on the customerâ€™s phone number.
A printed receipt can be generated using a thermal printer.
Save the order details in the backend with a status as "Placed."
Step 2: Order Fulfillment (Sales Counter):

Salesperson scans the QR code or enters the OTP manually on a dual-screen tablet.
The system fetches the order and displays it on both customer and salesperson screens (read-only for customers, editable for the salesperson).
Salesperson marks the status as "Complete," "Partial," or "Refund" based on item availability.
If some items are missing, they will update the order, and the backend updates the database.
Step 3: Delivery and Refund:

If items are missing, customers can revisit the token counter for a refund.
If the order is complete, the order status is updated to "Delivered."
